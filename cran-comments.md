## Resubmission 3

This is a resubmission. In this version I have added some new features and fixed a few bugs. 


## New Features

* We have updated the `initials_adjpin()` function, which generates initial 
parameter sets for the adjusted PIN model, to align with the algorithm outlined
in Ersan and Ghachem (2024).

## Bugfixes

* We have rectified an issue in the `mpin_ecm()` function. In cases where an observation in the E-step of the ECM algorithm had a zero probability of belonging to any cluster, we decided to assign it a uniform probability of belonging to each cluster, calculated as `1` divided by the total number of clusters (`cls`). Previously, the code erroneously assumed a fixed number of clusters (`6`), which has now been replaced with the variable `cls` to accommodate varying cluster sizes.

* We have enhanced the format and performance of polynomial root calculations 
within the conditional-maximization steps of the ECM algorithm. These enhancements
are implemented in the `solve_eqx` function.

* We've addressed two concerns related to the dependency package future. Firstly, previous code assigned variables to the global environment for parallel calls of the function `.get_lagged_value`, potentially yielding unexpected results. The updated code employs lexical scoping using the `local()` function to manage the variable `.lwbound` between function calls. Secondly, the previous code set the maximum size of futures to `+Inf` upon package loading, potentially impacting other packages. The option to adjust this value is now left to the user.

## Resubmission 2

This is a resubmission. In this version I have added some new features and fixed a few bugs. 


### New Features

* We introduce a new function called `classify_trades()` that enables users to
classify high-frequency (HF) trades individually, without aggregating them.  
For each HF trade, the function assigns a variable that is set to `TRUE` if the
trade is buyer-initiated, or `FALSE` if it is seller-initiated.

* The `aggregate_trades()` function enables users to aggregate high-frequency
(HF) trades at different frequencies. In the previous version, HF trades were 
automatically aggregated into daily trade data. However, with the updated 
version, users can now specify the desired frequency, such as every 15 minutes.

### Bugfixes

* We identified and corrected an error in the `mpin_ecm()` function. Previously,
the function would sometimes produce inconsistent results as the posterior 
distribution allowed for the existence of information layers with a probability
of zero. We have now fixed this issue and the function produces correct results.

* We have made some updates to the `mpin_ml()` function to better handle cases 
where the MPIN estimation fails for all initial parameter sets. Specifically, 
we have fixed an error in the display of the estimation results when such failure
occurs. With these updates, the function should now be able to handle such 
failures more robustly and provide appropriate feedback.

* We have simplified the ECM estimation functions, with a particular focus on
the adjpin() function. We have improved the convergence condition of the 
iterative process used in the ECM estimation. Moreover, we rounded the values
of the parameters at each iteration to a relevant number of decimals. This
shall result in a faster convergence and prevent issues with decreasing 
likelihood values."

## Resubmission 1

This is a resubmission. In this version I have added some new features and fixed a few bugs. 


### New Features

 * The functions `pin()`, `pin_*()`, `mpin_ml()`, `mpin_ecm()`, `adjpin()`,
 `vpin()`, and `aggregate_trades()` accept now, for their arguments `data`,
 datasets of type `matrix`. In the previous version, it only accepted 
 dataframes, which did not allow users, for instance, to use `rollapply()` of
 the package `zoo`.

  * Introduction of the function `pin_bayes()` that estimates the original pin
  model using a bayesian approach as described in Griffin et al.(2021).  
 
### Bugfixes

 * Fixed an error in the function `initials_pin_ea()` as it used to produce
 some parameter sets with negative values for trade intensity rates. The negative
 trade intensity rates are set to zero.

 * Fixed two errors in the function `vpin()`: one is related to an estimation 
 error, and the argument `verbose` did not work properly.
 
 * Fixed an issue with resetting the plan for the future (`future::plan`) 
 used for parallel processing.

### Test environments

* local windows 10 , R 4.2.1

* macOS 10.13.6 High Sierra, R-release, CRAN's setup - R 4.3

### R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

There is one NOTE that is only found on Windows (Server 2022, R-devel 64-bit): 

```
* checking for detritus in the temp directory ... NOTE
Found the following files/directories:

```
As noted in [R-hub issue #503](https://github.com/r-hub/rhub/issues/503), this could be due to a bug/crash in MiKTeX and can likely be ignored.

Explanation: 

The presumably misspelled words are either:

- concepts, or abbreviations related to statistical models in Finance
(e.g. AdjPIN stands for Adjusted Probability of informed trading). This
also concerns AdjPIN, MPIN, Multilayer, and VPIN.

- Researcher names: Ersan, Duarte, Easley

- 'et', and 'al', together form 'et al.', which is an abbreviation 
meaning “and others.”; used to shorten lists of author names in text 
citations.
