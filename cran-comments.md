Explanation: 

The presumably misspelled words are either:

- concepts, or abbreviations related to statistical models in Finance
(e.g. AdjPIN stands for Adjusted Probability of informed trading). This
also concerns AdjPIN, MPIN, Multilayer, and VPIN.

- Researcher names: Ersan, Duarte, Easley

- 'et', and 'al', together form 'et al.', which is an abbreviation 
meaning “and others.”; used to shorten lists of author names in text 
citations.
